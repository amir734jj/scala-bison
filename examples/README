Example Uses of ScalaBison

This directory has two examples using ScalaBison.
The main source includes also a parser for Bison grammars.

The "Calc" grammar takes an example from the bison manual together with
a scanner implemented using the "--scala" option of JFlex.
The "Calc" object can be used to execute the parser and scanner on standard input.

The Java grammar is directly from the Java Language Specification.
It is not set up for execution although it will compile.
(There is no scanner).

The Makefile in this directory allows one to build the various parsers.
It also (because it uses the script ../cmd/scala-bison) creates .lcoutput files
that show the "left corner" parsing tables used.
